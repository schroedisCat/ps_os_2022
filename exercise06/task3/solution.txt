What is the advantage of using a condition variable in this case, 
compared to using plain mutexes? 

    Because you don't have a busy waiting condition; 
    You only check once if the Queue is empty and otherwise it waits for the signal.


How does the program behavior differ between the two variants? 
    task3 is far faster than task 2 

    System times:   task2 --> 76,68
                    task3 --> 19.14
