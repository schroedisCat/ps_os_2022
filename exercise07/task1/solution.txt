System time on home laptop:

    Mutex:      10,4 Seconds
    Atomic:      0,06 Seconds

The atomic variant is a lot faster than the one with mutex. Thats maybe because it is only an integer, which can be accessed only from
one thread at a time. When using mutex you have a lot more to do background.
